# Football Injury AI Prediction System

This project focuses on predicting football player injuries using **pre-match** statistics and, in the future, **in-match** real-time data. It is designed to assist coaches and medical staff in making better, proactive decisions to prevent player injuries.

## Project Overview

Injuries can drastically affect team performance and player health. This AI-driven system uses structured football data from API-Football to anticipate injury risks **before matches** (and eventually **during live games**).

Our solution focuses on:
- Past player & team statistics
- Current match context (opponent analysis)
- Recent match history (team & opponent performance)
- [Coming soon] In-match stats (e.g., distance covered, sprint counts, fatigue indicators)

The system was built using a machine learning pipeline with **XGBoost** as the primary classification algorithm, achieving an F1 score of **0.80** and accuracy of **0.85**, significantly outperforming baseline predictions.

## üìä Data Collection Process

The data collection involves several steps:

### 1. Positive Sample Generation (`pos_samples_generation.ipynb`)

This notebook collects data for players who suffered injuries:

1. **Injury Data Collection**:
   - Query the API for players with recorded injuries in the 2024 season
   - Extract injury dates, player details, and match contexts

2. **Feature Expansion**:
   - For each injury, identify:
     - The opponent team
     - Previous 5 fixtures for the player's team
     - Previous 5 fixtures for the opponent team

3. **Previous Season Stats**:
   - Gather player statistics from the previous season (2023)
   - Include comprehensive metrics like appearances, goals, assists, etc.

4. **Raw Stats Collection**:
   - For each of the previous 5 matches:
     - Collect player-specific performance metrics
     - Team aggregate statistics (shots, possession, passing accuracy)
     - Opponent team statistics

### 2. Negative Sample Generation (`neg_samples_generation.ipynb`)

This notebook collects data for non-injured players to create balanced training data:

1. **Non-Injury Player Identification**:
   - Find players who participated in matches without injuries
   
2. **Random Fixture Selection**:
   - For each non-injured player, randomly select 5 fixtures they participated in
   - Tag these as "non-injury" examples (label = 0)

3. **Feature Parity**:
   - Apply the same feature extraction process as positive samples
   - Ensure negative examples have identical feature structure

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Both positive and negative samples undergo identical preprocessing:

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Transform raw API responses into structured features
  - Handle missing values
  - Normalize and standardize metrics

- **Temporal Features**:
  - Calculate days since last injury
  - Count injury occurrences in the last 6 months

- **Comparative Metrics**:
  - Generate team vs. opponent differential metrics
  - Calculate performance ratios between teams

## üîç Feature Engineering

The system leverages a rich set of features derived from raw data:

### Player-Specific Features
- Recent form indicators (avg. minutes, rating, shots, goals)
- Physical load metrics (duels, tackles, fouls)
- Performance consistency measures
- Historical injury patterns
- Position-specific metrics

### Team Context Features
- Team's recent shooting efficiency
- Ball possession patterns
- Team passing accuracy
- Defensive metrics (tackles, interceptions)
- Set piece statistics (corners, free kicks)

### Opponent Analysis Features
- Opponent's aggressive play indicators
- Match difficulty based on opponent form
- Opponent pressing intensity

### Derived Interaction Features
- Team vs. opponent statistical differentials
- Performance ratios (shots, possession, passing)
- Historical matchup patterns

## ü§ñ Model Architecture

The core predictive engine uses **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting framework known for its performance in structured data problems:

1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   - Feature cleaning and normalization
   - Missing value imputation
   - Feature selection based on importance

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - Optimized hyperparameters (n_estimators=80, learning_rate=0.1)
   - Cross-validation with StratifiedGroupKFold to prevent data leakage
   - Group-based splitting by player_id to ensure no player appears in both train/test sets

3. **Training Strategy**:
   - F1-macro optimization (balancing precision and recall)
   - Per-fold feature importance analysis
   - Permutation importance for robust feature selection

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Overall F1 Score: 0.80
   - Accuracy: 0.85
   - Significant improvement over baseline (0.41 F1 / 0.69 accuracy)
